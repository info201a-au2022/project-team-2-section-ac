# I want to find the ratio of away wins:home wins and see which teams win more at home vs. which teams
# win more away. I will be ignoring ties (because a tie doesn't equal a win or loss). 

# The data below is very similar to the above data, except this time I was preparing the data for visualization so I called the away win ratio only "ratio" and created a new column called "Away" that I could then use in my key.
