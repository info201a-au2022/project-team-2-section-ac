# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Deeana_source_file.R](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-team-2-section-ac/blob/main/source/Deeana_source_file.R) | This file holds the code that produces the data visulaization of the goal density per national team.
|[table.sourcefile.R](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-team-2-section-ac/blob/main/source/table.sourcefile.R) | This file holds the code that generates a summary table of our data. 


# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ...
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
