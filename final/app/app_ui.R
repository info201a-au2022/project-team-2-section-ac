      is the result of all the first official matches beginning from 1872
      and ending in 2019. Looking at the sociotechnical part of this setting,
      it’s evident that the technical aspect of gathering this data was
      impacted by our society’s culture and traditions around sports.
      The data only includes matches from men’s soccer games, excluding
      women’s soccer games; this is an important sociotechnical aspect
      that we need to keep in mind when using this data in our project.
      Project Framing: When working on this project, we will work together
      as a team to get our individual parts of the project completed. As a
      team, we value communication, and have multiple communication channels
      to achieve success. Human Values: A strong human value that we will
      be coming back to when completing this project is empathy. We will
      employ this human value when working with one another, making sure
      that if one of us is experiencing difficulties completing their part
      of the project, we will listen to them and help them out. Direct
      stakeholder: According to the FIFA Journal, the professional soccer
      industry has several direct stakeholders, including “soccer
      associations, confederations, clubs, league and players”
      (FIFA Journal). Soccer clubs, for instance, can use this data to
      see which teams have been the most successful in the past several
      years and therefore use this information when scouting for new players.
      Indirect stakeholder: According to a recent study about ethical

      include soccer coaches. While soccer coaches may not directly seek
      this data, the board of soccer clubs may use this information to
      impact their relationship with individual coaches, making coaches
      indirect stakeholders. Benefits: One benefit of this data is that
      in general, according to an article by The Guardian, soccer data is
      hard to analyze. There are many factors that go into determining
      whether a team will be successful or not; therefore, getting this
      large collection of data that goes back to 1872 will help in the
      long run of making soccer data better and easier to understand.
      Harms: A clear harm of this data is that it excluded women’s soccer.
      This data is even further harder to analyze due to a lack of
      collection, and this data set is continuing this pattern by excluding

      teams/players/supporters be informed on the status of their team’s

      scope to certain tournaments so analysis can be available to form
      conclusions on which tournaments certain teams excel or underperform
      at. Which national team was more likely to win in a penalty shootout?
      This question enables us to perform analysis on teams that are more
      likely to win a penalty shootout. This is a useful question for teams
      because it provides them information on their typical penalty shooters
      and whether or not they compare well to other teams. What is the goal
