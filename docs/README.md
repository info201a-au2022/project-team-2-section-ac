|[Project Proposal](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-team-2-section-ac/blob/main/docs/p01-proposal.md) |In this project, we pull data from the “International Football Results from 1872 to 2022” dataset, which provides information about different football teams’ performance over time, including which tournaments they played at, whether the game played was a home or away game, and the city / country the team is from. From this dataset, we hope to provide statistics to potential stakeholders like sports fans and team management about which teams are historically competitive, which teams perform better at home / away games, performance by tournament, and how two teams compare to each other 
|[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-team-2-section-ac/blob/main/docs/index.rmd) | In our exploratory data analysis, we created 3 visualizations based on various relationships in our soccer results data. The first visualization portrays the number of goals scored per team, seen in a heat map. The second visualization compares the away win ratio (away wins out of total away games played) and the home win ratio (home wins out of total home games played) over each decade. The last visualization compares England vs. Scotland's teams, looking at the number of goals scored over time.
|[Interactive Vizualizaiton](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-team-2-section-ac/blob/main/final/app/app.R) | This file contains the code for all three of our interactive data visualizations.
